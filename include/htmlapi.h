 * General Information
 * ======= ===========
 *
 * Descriptoin
 *
 * The HTML API provides program access to the Domino Web Server's CD to HTML conversion capability
 * for views, documents, and items.
 *
 *
 * Threading Issues.
 *
 * This API is  thread safe, in that it does not use any unprotected global state.
 * The HTML Converter Object itself is NOT concurrent -- you cannot use the
 * same object in multiple threads without somehow coordinating access yourself.
 * It does not really make sense to use one converter object in multiple threads anyway.
 */

/*
 * Per-Process Initialization / Termination
 * =========== ============== = ===========
 *
 * 	These deal with process-wide resources initialized and used for the
 * HTML API.
 *
 */

STATUS LNPUBLIC HTMLProcessInitialize();
/*
 * Initializes the HTML API process-wide resources.
 * Normally called once, when user process is initializing.
 * Calling this is Optional -- if not called, the first call to HTMLCreateConverter
 * 	will do initialization.
 * Multiple calls are OK -- they do not "nest" (i.e. multiple calls do not pair
 * 	with HTMLProcessTerminate().)
 * Calling this after a call to HTMLProcessTerminate() results in undefined behavior.
 * Threading: can be called from multiple threads concurrently  with HTMLCreateConverter()
 *
 * Results:
 *		ERR_HTMLAPI_INIT
 * 	-- other STATUS codes from internal calls.
 */

void LNPUBLIC HTMLProcessTerminate();
/*
 * Releases process wide resources.
 * Normally called once, when user process is terminating.
 *		Can be called earlier, if no other HTML API operations are to be performed.
 * Undefined behavior if
 *		- called before HTMLProcessInitialize()
 *		- called multiple times.
 * If not called, process will terminate with HTML API resources still allocated.
 * (Usually this is not a problem)
 * Threading: must be called from one thread, no other concurrent HTML API calls.

/*
 *	REFERENCES
 *	==========
 *
 *	An HTML page may contain references to other resources.  These are in the form of
 *	URLs that appear in anchor tags and elsewhere.  When converting a note to HTML,
 *	a number of references are generated.  References can be converted:
 *		+ automatically as part of decorating a page to be useful when viewed in
 *		a browser (next/previous links in a view, for example)
 *		+ when converting a database "link" to a URL.
 *		+ in a view, references to the actual documents.
 *
 *	These references are generated with a syntax that can be interpreted by the Domino
 *	Web Server, but might not be useful to the client of the API.
 *	So, we provide a means to examine the references on a page programatically and
 *	to replace the text of the reference with application supplied values.
 *
 *	references have the structure:
 *		type - value indicating how the reference is used.
 *		text - the URL text.
 *		command - the Domino 'url command' associated with the reference
 *		target
 *			- list of components naming the target of the reference
 *		arguments
 *			- list of name:value pairs representing the referene's arguments
